## About

A personal tracker to keep track of every mob (and mob variant) in Minecraft. Click a card to mark it as found, filter by category, search by name, and track your overall completion progress.

**A few things to know:**
- The code was written with the help of various AI tools
- Images are taken from the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/) or made by me
- Some information (names, variant counts, categories) might not be 100% accurate
- This is a personal project — no guarantees of completeness or correctness
